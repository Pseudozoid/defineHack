## Project Goal 
AI assisted sorting, disposal and management of bio-medical wastes.

## Overview
High-income countries generate on average up to 0.5 kg of hazardous waste per bed per day; while low-income countries generate on average 0.2kg. However, health-care waste is often not separated into hazardous or nonhazardous wastes in low-income countries making the real quantityof hazardous waste much higher.

### Magnitude Of Hospital Wastes In Kerala
On the basis of the number of hospitals and available beds, a tentative estimate of the quantum of wastes generated is arrived at 1, 30,000 the total number of beds.

The quantity of infectious wastes produced per bed, per day is reckoned at 2kg. Thus, the hospitals in the state generated more than 260 tonnes of infectious wastes every day or 95,000 tonnes annually.

### Hazards Of Medical Waste
Medical wastes can be hazardous due to the following reasons: 
* It contains infectious agents.
* It is genotoxic.
* It contains toxic or hazardous chemicals or pharmaceuticals.
* It is radioactive. 
* It contains 'sharps' (needles, scalpels, blades...etc)

### IMAGE - IMA Goes Eco-friendly
The project “IMAGE” – IMA Goes Eco-friendly was initiated in 2000 to assist Government and Private Hospitals in Kerala to manage and dispose the hazardous wastes produced in their premises. Although the project has solved a lot of issues associated with waste management and disposal, it still lags behind in terms of employing personnel for manual sorting and segregation of medical wastes. This poses a huge risk to the workers who are constantly at risk of infections, injuries and radiation.
